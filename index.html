<!-- Jokes aside, yes, this was all coded by me. "Omg Adam you know nothing about coding. Look at the HTML, it's soooooo short". Bruh shut up. Click "script.js" under <head>...</head>in the code below. YW in advance-->
<!-- The animations you see happening are video files, you can go to https://github.com/oodumofficial/adamtamparis2020/ to see the video and image files -->


<!-- Some QnA: -->

<!-- Q: Can I take the code and use it for my own slideshows? -->
<!-- A: Yes. Go the the github link above and steal the code, just replace it with your own files. Not gonna teach you how to use it tho -->

<!-- Q: How long does it take you? -->
<!-- A: A long ass time, so don't do this unless you're ready to stare at a screen for 8+ hours OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL with 0 distractions -->

<!-- Q: Why? Why would you even spend that much time when I can make a slideshow and get high marks too? -->
<!-- A: Why do you care about how the food tastes if it's going to do relatively the same job, to fill you? Quality, my friend. -->
